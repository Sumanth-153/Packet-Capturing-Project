# Packet Capturing Project

This project focuses on capturing and analyzing network packets using Python.  
It demonstrates how data packets travel across a network and how they can be monitored for cybersecurity analysis.  
The main goal of this project is to understand the process of packet sniffing and how tools like Scapy can be used to inspect network traffic for learning and research purposes.
